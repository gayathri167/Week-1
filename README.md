# Week-1
This project uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to classify and sort waste plastics for efficient recycling. By training the model on diverse plastic images, it automates the identification of plastic types, improving recycling accuracy, reducing contamination, and supporting sustainable waste management solutions.
